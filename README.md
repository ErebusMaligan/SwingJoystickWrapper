# SwingJoystickWrapper
Wrapper for LWJGL that provides event support for swing widgets, similar to standard MouseEvents


Some day i'll write instructions on how to use it for someone else



requires libs/LWJGL/jar/lwjgl.jar

running lwjgl requires the vm param to point to the native path

for instance

-Djava.library.path="D:\libs\LWJG\native"
